![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbrantgerald%2FToDo-App)


This web application is a simple to use to-do list for tracking tasks. It allows you to add, delete, and edit individual tasks and store them in your local storage on your browsers cache. This makes it easy for saving without having to login to a server.

## Project Status

This project is currently fully functional, but is still under development for new features and UI upgrades. This is primarily a learning tool for my Web application development skills.

## Requirements

This is a web application that is currently unhosted. If you want to use it, you can download the source files and run the code locally in a web browser.

## Installation

There is no required installation for this project. This is ran within your local browser application.

## Future Developments

I plan to incorporate new features in future releases. Some of the ones on my list include:

- Task grouping
- Better formatting of text
- Ability to add notes under each task
